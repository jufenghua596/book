// The number of birds migrating to Objective has overwhelmed the Quackologists
// who are complaining that it is hard to keep up because the journaling program
// you wrote is getting sluggish. Quackologists capture birds, categorize them, 
// weight them, tag them, and finally, record them with your program. After hours 
// of drinking coffee at Starbuzz reviewing your design, you realize that some 
// traits are common to each type of bird; its type, the sound it makes and how
// it swims. If only you could isolate the common (intrinsic) traits from the 
// unique (extrinsic) traits, its weight and tag number. Your redesign implements
// the ‘Flyweight’ pattern by creating a single instance for each type of bird and
// each bird contains a reference back to its type.
