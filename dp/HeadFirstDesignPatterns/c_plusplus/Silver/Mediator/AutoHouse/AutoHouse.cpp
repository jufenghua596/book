// The 'Mediator' pattern is discussed on page 622 in 'Head First Design Patterns'.

// As always, my intent is to implement the example as described in the book; however,
// there are some embellishments: WeatherStation and automation.
//
// The WeatherStation knows if it is raining and automation is accomplished by two
// variables: 'interval' and 'iterations' specifying the length of a virtual day
// and the number of days to simulate respectively. The default is a simulated
// (yet accelerated) 24 hour day that runs for a simulated week. 
//
// You can override these values with command-line parameters.
