* Learning Cython README
These are all the cython code examples used within the book for easy
reference and for me to be able to maintain these in the future. To
keep not only the book relevant but the code aswell.

Here are some useful links to relevant links that you would care about.

-Cython: http://www.cython.org/
-Cython Official Reference: http://docs.cython.org/
-Cython Wiki: http://wiki.cython.org/

** Chapter 1 Intro
Deals with just hello world and a simple walk through of your own
module from scratch!

** Chatper 2 Cdef and mixing C/Python
Here things get more interesting with reusing:
- Python ConfigParser
- Python logging
To extend new C projects to get them up and running FAST

Then iterating over the cdef usage as a reference and the cython
public keyword usage and how to handle the new header file.

*** Messaging Server
Finally a fairly quick and hacky messaging server written in an hour
in C and Cython using libevent over simple Sockets. Demonstrates how
to get the most of cython to extend existing systems.

** Chapter 3 Cython Conventions 
There are 3 parts to this chapter firstly on how to use cython to
generate Python'esque classes for your C/C++ types with respect to
Memory Management.

*** Memory
Such as the __dealloc__ hook when python GC
decides to delete your objects. As well as using malloc/sizeof etc
from cython in the __cinit__ and __str__ hooks to make it really feel
like just any normal python code.

*** Speed
Using cython to simply compile your python code to get speed ups in
number crunching in the primes example from cython compared to a
plain nearly word for word match in pure python

*** Extending Tmux
Extending existing Open Source projects using pure Cython instead of
using C!

** Chapter 4 Caveats and Debugging
This chapter deals with some caveats in Type Conversion you might
come across and how to use cygdb on your code.

** Chapter 5 Advanced Cython
Advanced topics with cython include using C++ with cython and how to
interface with that. And a little intro on how to worry about the GIL
releated to threading. And finally 2 more examples on how you could
extend systems with cython.

** Chapter 6 Cython extra's
Rounding off the book with a discussion on Python 3 and PyPy. And a
quick look at the Auto PXD tools for cython that are available.
